# Explanation of Attribute Loading Issue in Human Grader V2

The attributes were not loading in Human Grader V2 due to a few reasons:

1. **Data Structure**: The attributes in the database might not have the structure expected by the component. The component was expecting each attribute to have a `name` and `options` property, which might not be present in the data returned from the API.

2. **Error Handling**: The component didn't have proper error handling for cases where the attributes or their properties were undefined.

3. **Data Fetching**: The attributes were being fetched from the Redux store, but there was no check to ensure that the data had been loaded before trying to use it.

To fix these issues, the following changes were made:

1. Updated the `HumanGraderV2` component to handle cases where attribute properties might be undefined.
2. Added a check to ensure that both products and attributes are loaded before rendering the main content.
3. Updated the server-side `/api/attributes` endpoint to return the full attribute data, including any options.

These changes should allow the attributes to load correctly in Human Grader V2. If you're still experiencing issues, please check the following:

1. Ensure that the `/api/attributes` endpoint is returning the expected data structure.
2. Check the Redux DevTools (if installed) to verify that the attributes are being correctly stored in the Redux state.
3. Add more detailed error logging in the component and the API endpoint to help identify any remaining issues.

Remember to always handle potential undefined values and add proper error states in your components to make debugging easier in the future.
