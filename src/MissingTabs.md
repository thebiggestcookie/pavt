# Missing Tabs to Rebuild

Based on the current navigation menu in the App.js file, there are no missing tabs. The current navigation includes:

1. Home
2. Product Generator
3. Attribute Editor
4. Attribute Editor V2

These tabs cover all the main functionalities that were previously implemented. However, if there were any additional tabs or features in the original application that are not reflected in the current App.js file, they would need to be rebuilt. Some potential additional tabs that might have been present in a more comprehensive product attribute management system could include:

1. Category Manager: For managing product categories and subcategories.
2. Bulk Import/Export: For handling large-scale data operations.
3. User Management: If the application supports multiple users with different roles.
4. Analytics Dashboard: For viewing statistics and insights about the product attributes.
5. Settings: For configuring application-wide settings.

To rebuild any of these or other missing tabs, you would need to:

1. Create new React components for each tab.
2. Add new routes in the App.js file.
3. Include new links in the navigation menu.
4. Implement the necessary functionality within each new component.
5. Update the backend API if required to support new features.

Please review the original requirements and design of the application to identify any specific tabs or features that might be missing from the current implementation.
