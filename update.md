# Database Initialization Issue and Fix

## Current Problem

The error message indicates that there's an issue with the ON CONFLICT clause in one of our SQL statements. Specifically, it's saying that there's no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification. This typically happens when we're trying to use ON CONFLICT on a column or set of columns that don't have a unique constraint.

## Root Cause

The problem is likely occurring in the initialization of the products table. We're using ON CONFLICT (name), but we haven't explicitly defined a unique constraint on the 'name' column when creating the table.

## Proposed Fix

To resolve this issue, we need to modify our table creation SQL to add unique constraints where necessary. Here's what we'll do:

1. Modify the CREATE TABLE statement for the products table to include a UNIQUE constraint on the 'name' column.
2. Add UNIQUE constraints to other tables where we're using ON CONFLICT clauses.
3. Wrap the entire initialization process in a transaction to ensure atomicity.

## Implementation Plan

1. Update the `initializeDatabase` function in `server.js`:
   - Modify the CREATE TABLE statements to include UNIQUE constraints.
   - Wrap the entire initialization process in a transaction.

2. After making these changes, we'll need to drop and recreate the tables in the database. This can be done by:
   - Connecting to the database using psql or another PostgreSQL client.
   - Dropping all existing tables.
   - Restarting the server to reinitialize the database.

3. Test the application to ensure that all functionality works as expected after the database reinitialization.

These changes should resolve the ON CONFLICT issue and allow the database to initialize properly.
