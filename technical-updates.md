# Technical Updates

## 1. Initial Implementation
- Implemented `generateProduct` function in `src/utils/api.js`
- Used axios to make POST request to '/api/generate' endpoint
- Passed prompt as data in the request body
- Expected response format: `{ response: string }`

## 2. Error Handling Enhancement
- Added try-catch block in `generateProduct` function
- Logged detailed error information using console.error
- Threw custom error with message for non-200 status codes

## 3. Timeout Configuration
- Added timeout configuration to axios instance
- Set timeout to 30000ms (30 seconds)
- Purpose: Prevent indefinite waiting for response

## 4. API Endpoint Fallback
- Implemented fallback mechanism in `generateProduct` function
- On 404 error, retry request with '/api/generate-product' endpoint
- Used nested try-catch for fallback logic

## 5. Response Validation
- Added check for response data format in `generateProduct`
- Verified that response.data is an object and has 'response' property
- Threw custom error if format is incorrect

## 6. Debug Logging
- Implemented debug logging throughout the generation process
- Used custom `debug` function to log steps and responses
- Added debug information display in ProductGenerator component

## 7. Error Message Improvement
- Enhanced error messages in ProductGenerator component
- Included more context about the failure point (e.g., which step failed)
- Displayed full error message from API in the UI

## 8. API Base URL Configuration
- Used environment variable REACT_APP_API_URL for API base URL
- Fallback to 'https://pavt-db.onrender.com' if env variable not set

## 9. Authentication Token Handling
- Implemented interceptor to add Authorization header to requests
- Used 'Bearer' token stored in localStorage

## 10. Prompt Management
- Fetched prompts from backend using `fetchPrompts` function
- Stored prompts in component state
- Allowed editing of prompts in the UI for testing purposes

# Attempted Solutions That Did Not Work

1. Changing API Endpoint
   - Tried both '/api/generate' and '/api/generate-product'
   - Both resulted in 404 errors

2. Fallback Mechanism
   - Implemented fallback from '/api/generate' to '/api/generate-product'
   - Did not resolve the issue as both endpoints returned 404

3. Timeout Adjustment
   - Increased timeout from default to 30 seconds
   - Did not resolve the issue as the problem was a 404 error, not a timeout

4. Authentication Token
   - Added 'Bearer' token to requests
   - Did not resolve the 404 error, suggesting it's not an authentication issue

5. Error Handling Improvements
   - Enhanced error logging and display
   - Helped in debugging but did not resolve the underlying issue

6. Response Validation
   - Added checks for expected response format
   - Never reached this point due to 404 errors

7. Environment Variable for API URL
   - Used REACT_APP_API_URL with fallback
   - Did not resolve the issue, suggesting the problem is not with the base URL

8. Prompt Management
   - Implemented fetching and editing of prompts
   - Worked for prompt management, but did not affect the product generation issue

Current Status:
- Product generation consistently fails with 404 error
- Both '/api/generate' and '/api/generate-product' endpoints return 404
- Suspicion: Backend API might not have these endpoints implemented or accessible

Next Potential Steps:
1. Verify backend API documentation for correct endpoints
2. Implement mock API responses for testing frontend in isolation
3. Add network request logging to see exact request being sent
4. Test API endpoints directly (e.g., using Postman) to isolate frontend vs backend issues
5. Consider implementing retry mechanism with exponential backoff
6. Investigate potential CORS issues if API is on different domain
