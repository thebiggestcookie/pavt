# PAVT Rebuild

This document outlines the changes made to the PAVT (Product Attribute Verification Tool) system and provides instructions for deployment and usage.

## Changes Made

1. HumanGraderInterface.js:
   - Updated to fetch only unverified products
   - Improved attribute selection UI
   - Fixed metrics calculation

2. server.js:
   - Updated product update endpoint to include human_attributes and human_verified fields
   - Added error handling and logging

3. api.js:
   - Updated fetchProductsToGrade to filter unverified products
   - Modified gradeProduct to include human_attributes

4. ProductGenerator.js:
   - Integrated with LLM configurations
   - Added error handling and loading states
   - Improved UI for subcategory and LLM config selection

## Deployment Instructions

1. Set up a new subdomain for this version (e.g., new-pavt.yourdomain.com)
2. Create a new database for this version to avoid conflicts with the existing one
3. Update the .env file with the new database connection string and subdomain URL
4. Deploy the updated code to your hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean)
5. Run database migrations to set up the new schema

## Usage

To access the new version:

1. Visit https://new-pavt.yourdomain.com (replace with your actual subdomain)
2. Log in using existing credentials (or create a new account if needed)
3. Use the updated interfaces for product generation and human grading

## Safety Considerations

While the changes made are significant improvements, there are some considerations before shipping:

1. Thorough testing is required, especially for the HumanGraderInterface and ProductGenerator
2. Ensure that the new database is properly set up and migrated
3. Verify that the LLM integration works correctly with different configurations
4. Monitor the system closely after deployment for any unexpected behavior

It's recommended to deploy this version to a staging environment first for thorough testing before making it publicly available.
