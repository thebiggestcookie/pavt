# Updates

## Update #23 (2023-08-19)
- Modified the `generateProduct` function in `src/utils/api.js`
  - Added a fallback mechanism to try '/api/generate-product' endpoint if '/api/generate' returns a 404 error
  - This change aims to address the persistent 404 errors when generating products
  - Status: Implemented, needs testing

- Updated error handling in `src/components/ProductGenerator.js`
  - Improved error messages to provide more context about failures
  - Status: Implemented, needs testing

- Next steps:
  - Test the product generation process with the new fallback mechanism
  - Monitor the API responses to determine which endpoint is actually working
  - If issues persist, investigate the backend API to ensure the correct endpoints are implemented and accessible
  - Consider adding a configuration option to specify the correct API endpoint for product generation

Note: The persistent 404 errors suggest that there might be a mismatch between the frontend expectations and the backend implementation. It's crucial to verify the backend API structure and ensure it aligns with the frontend requests.
