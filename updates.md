# Updates

## Update #11
- Revised ProductGenerator component
  - Updated prompt fetching logic to match the actual API response format
  - Added check for empty prompt content
  - Status: Implemented, needs testing
  - Technical details:
    - Changed prompt name checks from 'Product Generator Step 1' to 'Step 1' and 'Product Generator Step 2' to 'Step 2'
    - Added error message for empty prompt content
  - Debugging notes:
    - Issue: Prompts are fetched but content is empty
    - Possible cause: Prompts in the database have empty content
    - Next step: Verify prompt content in the database and update if necessary

- Updated HumanGraderV2 component
  - Added check for HTML response instead of JSON
  - Improved error handling for empty product list
  - Status: Implemented, needs testing
  - Technical details:
    - Added check for HTML string in response data
    - Updated error message when no products are available for grading
  - Debugging notes:
    - Issue: Receiving HTML instead of JSON for product data
    - Possible cause: Server configuration issue or authentication problem
    - Next step: Check server routes and middleware, ensure proper API endpoint configuration

## Update #12
- Further updated HumanGraderV2 component
  - Enhanced error handling for API requests
  - Added explicit headers to axios request
  - Status: Implemented, needs testing
  - Technical details:
    - Added 'Accept' and 'Content-Type' headers to axios request
    - Implemented more detailed error logging for different types of errors (response, request, other)
    - Added specific error message for authentication failure (401 status)
  - Debugging notes:
    - Issue: Receiving HTML instead of JSON persists
    - Possible causes:
      1. Authentication issue: User might not be logged in or session expired
      2. Server-side routing issue: API endpoint might be misconfigured
      3. CORS issue: Server might not be set up to handle requests from the frontend origin
    - Next steps:
      1. Verify user authentication status and implement proper login flow if needed
      2. Review server-side routing for '/api/products-to-grade' endpoint
      3. Check CORS configuration on the server
      4. Implement server-side logging to capture any errors occurring during the API request handling

- Next steps:
  - Test updated HumanGraderV2 component with proper authentication
  - Review server-side code for '/api/products-to-grade' endpoint
  - Implement server-side logging for API requests and responses
  - Consider adding a health check endpoint to verify API availability
  - Review and update prompt content in the database for ProductGenerator
