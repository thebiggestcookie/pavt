# Major Learnings for Future Development

1. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling in all components and API calls.
   - Use a logging system to capture and report errors in both frontend and backend.
   - Consider using error boundaries in React to prevent entire app crashes.

2. **State Management:**
   - When using Redux or any state management library, ensure all necessary reducers and actions are properly set up and connected.
   - Implement proper error handling in Redux actions and reducers.

3. **API Integration:**
   - Ensure all API endpoints are correctly implemented on the backend and properly called from the frontend.
   - Use interceptors for common error handling in API calls.

4. **Component Lifecycle:**
   - Pay attention to component lifecycle methods or hooks, especially for data fetching.
   - Implement loading states and error states for all data-dependent components.

5. **Routing:**
   - Ensure all routes are properly set up and components are correctly imported.
   - Implement route guards or checks for authenticated routes.

6. **Data Flow:**
   - Ensure data is properly passed down to child components, either through props or global state.
   - Implement proper data fetching strategies (e.g., on component mount, on-demand, etc.).

7. **Performance:**
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading for larger applications.
   - Use memoization techniques for expensive computations or rerenders.

8. **Testing:**
   - Implement unit tests for critical functions and components.
   - Set up integration tests for key user flows.
   - Use snapshot testing for UI components to catch unexpected changes.

9. **Deployment:**
   - Set up proper build processes for production deployments.
   - Use environment variables for configuration that changes between environments.

10. **Debugging:**
    - Implement debug logging in key areas of the application.
    - Use browser developer tools and React Developer Tools for frontend debugging.
    - Set up proper backend logging and monitoring.

By keeping these points in mind during development, many common issues can be prevented or more easily diagnosed and fixed.
