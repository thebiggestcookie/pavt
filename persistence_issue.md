# Persistence Issues with Prompts and API Keys

## The Problem

The prompts and API keys are not persisting after deployments. This is likely because the data is being stored in-memory or in a temporary database that gets wiped clean with each new deployment.

## The Solution

To fix this issue, we need to implement a persistent storage solution. Here's what we're going to do:

1. Use a persistent database: We'll switch to using a PostgreSQL database hosted on a platform like Heroku or AWS RDS. This will ensure our data survives deployments.

2. Update our database schema: We'll create tables for storing prompts and API keys.

3. Modify our server code: We'll update our server.js file to interact with the persistent database instead of using in-memory storage.

4. Implement data migration: We'll create a script to migrate any existing data to the new database structure.

5. Update environment variables: We'll ensure that the database connection string is properly set in the environment variables of our deployment platform.

By implementing these changes, we'll ensure that our prompts and API keys persist across deployments, providing a more stable and reliable application.
