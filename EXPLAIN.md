# Explanation of Approach and Future Improvements

## Current Approach

The current approach involves creating separate files for components, actions, and reducers, and then integrating them into the main application. This modular approach is generally good for maintainability and scalability.

## Issues and Improvements

1. **Blank Screen Issue:**
   The blank screen when clicking on Human Grader V2 could be due to several reasons:
   - Redux store might not be properly set up or connected.
   - There might be an error in the component that's not being caught or displayed.
   - The necessary data might not be loaded when the component mounts.

   To fix this, we should:
   - Implement error boundaries in React to catch and display errors.
   - Add more comprehensive error handling in the component.
   - Ensure all necessary data is loaded before rendering the main content of the component.

2. **Proactive Error Prevention:**
   To prevent similar issues in the future, we should:
   - Implement a more robust error handling and logging system.
   - Add more extensive testing, including unit tests and integration tests.
   - Use TypeScript to catch type-related errors at compile-time.

3. **Code Quality and Maintainability:**
   - Implement ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style.
   - Use PropTypes or TypeScript for better type checking.
   - Implement code reviews as part of the development process.

4. **Performance:**
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading for larger applications.
   - Use performance profiling tools to identify and fix bottlenecks.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
   - Use staging environments to catch issues before they reach production.

## Prompting vs. File Analysis

While analyzing the files can provide a lot of information about the structure and potential issues in the code, some problems (like the blank screen issue) might only become apparent during runtime or through user reports.

Therefore, a combination of file analysis and specific prompting about issues is the most effective approach. File analysis can help identify potential structural issues or missing dependencies, while specific prompts about runtime behavior or user-reported issues can help pinpoint problems that aren't immediately obvious from the code alone.

In an ideal scenario, comprehensive logging and error reporting would be implemented, allowing for easier diagnosis of issues without the need for extensive prompting. However, until such systems are in place, a combination of code analysis and specific issue reporting will likely be necessary.
